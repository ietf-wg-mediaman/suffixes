This document updates RFC 6838 "Media Type Specifications and Registration
Procedures" to describe how to interpret subtypes with multiple suffixes.

  <section anchor="intro">
    <name>Introduction</name>
    <t>
As written, RFC 6838 [RFC6838] permits the registration of media type subtype
names which contain any number of occurrences of the "+" character. RFC 6838
defines the characters following the first "+" character to be a structured
syntax suffix, but does not define anything further about how to interpret
subtype names containing more than one "+" character.
    </t>
    <t>
This document updates RFC 6838 to clarify how to interpret subtype names
containing more than one "+" character as subtypes with multiple suffixes.
    </t>
    <t>
As registration of media types which use a structured suffix has become widely
supported, this enables further specialization of media types that build on
already registered and well-defined media types which themselves use a
structured suffix.
    </t>

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD",
"SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when,
and only when, they appear in all capitals, as shown here.

  <section anchor="media-types-with-multiple-suffixes">
    <name>Media Types with Multiple Suffixes</name>
    <t>
This section is an addition to RFC 6838.
    </t>
    <t>
Media types MAY be registered with more than one structured suffix appended to
the base subtype name. Characters on the left-most side of the left-most "+" in
a subtype name specify the base subtype name. The entire structured suffix is
all of the characters to the right of the left-most "+" sign in the media type,
including the left-most "+" sign itself. The entire structured suffix MAY be
composed of one or more other structured suffixes. As an example, given the
"application/foo+bar+baz" media type: "application" is the top-level type,
"foo" is the base subtype name, "+bar+baz" is the entire structured suffix, and
"+baz" is the other structured suffix contained in the entire structured
suffix.
    </t>

    <section anchor="processing">
      <name>Processing Multiple Suffixes</name>
    <t>
This section is an addition to RFC 6838.
    </t>
      <t>
Registered media types have clear processing rules. In cases where specific
handling of the exact media type is not required, receivers of the media type
MAY do generic processing on the underlying representation
according to their ability to process any subset of the suffix(es) from left
to right inclusive. In other words, an application can choose to ignore the
base subtype name from a media type with multiple suffixes, and process
according to the remaining media type suffix(es).
      </t>
      <t>
This sort of generic processing of a portion of the media type MAY be utilized
by a processor that is capable of applying decoding rules associated with the
portion of the structured syntax suffix in the
<eref target="https://www.iana.org/assignments/media-type-structured-suffix/media-type-structured-suffix.xhtml">Structured Syntax Suffixes Registry</eref>.
      </t>
      <t>
When the entire structured suffix is composed of multiple structured suffixes,
those structured suffixes MUST be considered in left-to-right order. This is
done by considering the entire structured suffix first, and then dropping the
left-most suffix for each iteration of the structured suffix variations that are
considered. Note that "considering" a structured suffix variation does not mean
that an implementation has to process the data associated with each variation,
but it does mean that the variations that are considered do have a valid order
in which they are considered.
      </t>
      <t>
For example, for the media type "application/vc+ld+json", applications can
choose to process the underlying representation according to any one of the
following processing models, in the following order:
      </t>
      <ol>
        <li> application/vc+ld+json (as specified in the <eref target="https://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/media-types.xhtml">Media Type Registry</eref>)</li>
        <li> +ld+json (as specified in the <eref target="https://www.iana.org/assignments/media-type-structured-suffix/media-type-structured-suffix.xhtml">Structured Syntax Suffixes Registry</eref>)</li>
        <li> +json (as specified in the <eref target="https://www.iana.org/assignments/media-type-structured-suffix/media-type-structured-suffix.xhtml">Structured Syntax Suffixes Registry</eref>)</li>
      </ol>
      <t>
This means that a processor considers processing the entire media type
first, and then considers variations of the structured suffixes in most specific
to least specific (left-to-right) order; for example, "+ld+json" (more specific)
and then "+json" (less specific). The processor is never expected to process
"+ld" alone when presented with a "application/vc+ld+json" media type for
two reasons 1) doing so would be considered interpreting multiple structured
suffixes out of order, and 2) "+ld" is not a registered structured suffix type.
      </t>
      <t>
If an application choses to utilize a portion of the media type that is a
structured syntax suffix, the suffix MUST exist as an entry in the
<eref target="https://www.iana.org/assignments/media-type-structured-suffix/media-type-structured-suffix.xhtml">
Structured Syntax Suffixes Registry</eref>
and the specification referred to in the "Encoding Considerations"
entry of the registry MUST be used for both encoding and decoding the byte
stream associated with the media type.
      </t>
      <t>
In order to gain the most benefit from the media that is presented, and to
reduce the security attack surface for processed content, implementations that
are able to process multiple suffixes SHOULD process the most specific media
type or structured syntax suffix that they are able to process.
      </t>
      <t>
For processors that choose to process data associated with multiple structured
suffixes, if processing data according to any registered structured suffix type
fails, further processing on less specific structured suffixes SHOULD NOT be
performed.
      </t>

    <section anchor="fragments">
      <name>Fragment Identifiers</name>
    <t>
This section is an addition to RFC 6838.
    </t>
      <t>
The syntax and semantics for fragment identifiers are specified in the
"Fragment Identifier Considerations" column in the IANA Structured Syntax
Suffixes registry. In general, when processing fragment identifiers associated
with a structured syntax suffix, the following rules SHOULD be followed:
      </t>
      <ol>
        <li>
For cases defined for the structured syntax suffix, where the fragment
identifier does resolve per the structured syntax suffix rules, then
proceed as specified by the specification associated with the "Fragment
Identifier Considerations" column in the IANA Structured Syntax Suffixes
registry.
        </li>
        <li>
For cases defined for the structured syntax suffix, where the fragment
identifier does not resolve per the structured syntax suffix rules, then
proceed as specified by the specification associated with the full media type.
        </li>
        <li>
For cases not defined for the structured syntax suffix, then proceed as
specified by the specification associated with the full media type.
        </li>
      </ol>
    </section>

    <section anchor="structured-syntax-name-suffixes">
      <name>Structured Syntax Name Suffixes</name>
      <t>
The following paragraphs are additional guidance to Section 4.2.8
"Structured Syntax Name Suffixes", in RFC 6838.
      </t>

      <t>
Media types that make use of a named structured syntax, or similar separator
such as a dash "-", MUST ensure that the registration is semantically aligned,
from a data model perspective, with existing base subtype names in the media
type registry. For example, for the media types "application/foo+bar" and
"application/foo+baz", the expectation is that the semantics suggested by the
base subtype name "application/foo" are the same between both media types. The
Designated Expert MUST reject a registration if they believe the semantics for a
media type registration does not align with existing base subtype names in the
media type registry.
      </t>

      <t>
Registrants MUST prove to the Designated Expert, such as through an email to a
public mailing list or issue tracker comment, that they have consent from the
existing Change Controller for the associated base subtype name to register the
new media type.
      </t>

    </section>

    <section anchor="structured-syntax-suffix-registration-template">
      <name>Structured Syntax Suffix Registration Template</name>
      <t>
This section replaces Section 6.2 "Structured Syntax Suffix Registration
Template" in RFC 6838.
      </t>
      <t>
Media types containing more than one structured suffix MUST be registered
according to the procedure defined in [RFC6838] and this document.

      <section anchor="ss-validity">
        <name>Document Validity for Suffixes</name>
        <t>
If a toolchain chooses to process a provided media type by using the selected
structured suffix processing rules, it cannot presume that a document that is
valid per the decoding rules associated with the structured suffix
will be valid for a recognized subset of the structured suffix. For example,
presuming a media type of "application/foo+bar+baz", a toolchain cannot presume
that a valid "+baz" document will also be a valid "+bar+baz" document nor a
valid "application/foo+bar+baz" document. On the other hand, presuming a media
type of "application/foo+bar+baz", a toolchain <em>can</em> presume that a valid
"application/foo+bar+baz" document will also be a valid "+bar+baz" document
and a valid "+baz" document.
        </t>
      </section>

      <section anchor="ss-fragments">
        <name>Fragment Semantics for Suffixes</name>
        <t>
If a toolchain chooses to process a provided media type by using the selected
structured suffix processing rules, it cannot presume that fragment identifier
semantics will be the same across a recognized subset of the structured suffix.
For example, presuming a media type of "application/foo+bar+baz", a toolchain
cannot presume that the fragment semantics for a "+baz" document will
be the same as for a "+bar+baz" document or the same as for an
"application/foo+bar+baz" document.
        </t>
      </section>

      <section anchor="ss-security">
        <name>Security Characteristics for Suffixes</name>
        <t>
Toolchains cannot assume that the security characteristics of processing based
on structured suffixes will be the same for the entire media type nor for any
combination of recognized structured suffixes. For example, presuming a media
type of "application/foo+bar+baz", a toolchain cannot presume that the
security considerations for a "+baz" document will be the same as for a
"+bar+baz" document nor the same for an "application/foo+bar+baz" document.
        </t>
      </section>

      <section anchor="ss-partial-processing">
        <name>Partial Processing of Suffixes</name>
        <t>
It is possible for an attacker to utilize multiple structured suffixes in a way
that tricks unsuspecting toolchains into skipping important security checks
and allowing viruses to propagate. For example, an attacker might utilize an
"application/vnd.ms-excel.addin.macroEnabled.12+zip" structured suffix to
trigger an unzip process that might then directly invoke Microsoft Excel,
bypassing anti-virus tooling that would otherwise block a macro-enabled MS
Excel file containing a virus of some kind from being scanned or opened.
        </t>
        <t>
Enterprising attackers might take advantage of toolchains that partially
process media types in this manner. Toolchains that process media types based
purely on a structured suffix need to ensure that further processing does not
blindly trust the decoded data, and that proper magic header or file structure
checking is performed, before allowing the decoded data to drive operations that
might negatively impact the application environment or operating system.

    <t>
[RFC6838] established the Registration Procedure for the Structured Syntax
Suffixes Registry as "Expert Review". However, since the inception of the
registry, the Designated Experts have been operating as if the Registration
Procedure is "Specification Required" given that a specification is required in
the registration template for the "References" entry, which defines how the
structured suffix is to be used. Every entry in the Structured Syntax Suffixes
Registry contains at least one reference to a specification. Furthermore, this
document updates the Structured Syntax Suffixes Registry Registration
Template to include links to specifications for most fields. Therefore, there
is a clear requirement for at least one specification when performing a
Structured Syntax Suffix registration.
    </t>

    <t>
This section updates the Registration Procedure for the Structured Syntax
Suffixes Registry to "Specification Required" and instructs IANA to update the
existing registry to reflect this change.
